# Website template readme

1. You may design your company logo and replace the one on the nav bar and the page foot.
2. I have updated the webpage based on your comments. 
3. The page is based on pure HTML + JS + CSS, you can change the code based on your need.

## Message from Fan
This webpage can be intergrated into wordpress or linked to a background to quickly add/edit/remove the content. However, since now I believe this is a company index page that emphasises on 
introducing the services, team, and the company, there wont be too many content on the page. The pure HTML page is good and flexibly enough to maintain in this case.

We can make a backend if there is a need. Now you can change whatever you need by editing the code.
